# Elixir Data Structures - Exercises

This is an exercise in converting data structures into other data structures. 

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit the functions to make the tests pass by running `mix test`
3. Push your answers to your fork.

Currently, there are 3 files: atoms, conversions, and structs. Feel free to use whatever resource you have available to you.  Some of these functions will end up being a 1 liner. Some will require a little more effort.

You can get to a console by running `iex -S mix`
